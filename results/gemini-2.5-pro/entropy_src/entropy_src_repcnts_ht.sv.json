      "description": "The repetition counter, `rep_cntr`, is implemented using a standard `prim_count` primitive which is expected to wrap around to zero after reaching its maximum value. The failure condition is checked using a simple greater-than-or-equal-to comparison (`rep_cntr >= thresh_i`). If a stuck-at fault persists for an extended period (2^16 cycles, as `RegWidth` is 16), the counter will overflow and wrap back to zero. When this happens, the `rep_cnt_fail` condition will become false, effectively clearing the failure signal even though the input is still stuck. This could cause the system to miss a persistent catastrophic failure in the entropy source if the initial alert is not latched and handled before the counter wraps.",

      "impact": "A persistent stuck-at fault in the entropy source could be incorrectly assessed as a transient issue. If the system fails to react to the initial failure pulse before the 16-bit counter overflows, the `entropy_src` module will stop reporting the health failure. This would allow an entropy source that is completely non-random (stuck at a single value) to be treated as healthy, leading to the conditioning and distribution of compromised entropy. This could severely undermine all cryptographic operations relying on this entropy source.",
      "trigger_condition": "An attacker or a fault condition must cause the input `entropy_bit_i` to be stuck at a single value for 2^16 (65,536) consecutive valid samples. While the health test would initially fail when `rep_cntr` exceeds `thresh_i`, the failure signal would be cleared upon counter wrap-around, masking the ongoing fault.",
      "recommendations": "The repetition counter should be implemented as a saturating counter. Instead of wrapping to zero, it should 'stick' at its maximum value (`16'hFFFF`). This ensures that once a failure threshold is passed and the counter continues to increment, the `rep_cnt_fail` condition remains true indefinitely for a persistent fault. This can be achieved by replacing the generic `prim_count` with a custom counter that includes saturation logic, such as: `if (incr_en_i && rep_cntr < '1) rep_cntr <= rep_cntr + 1;`."
