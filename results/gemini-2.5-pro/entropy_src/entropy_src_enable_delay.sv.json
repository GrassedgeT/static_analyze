      "description": "The module uses a hardcoded, fixed-size timer (`MaxFifoWait` = 4 cycles) to wait for internal data FIFOs to drain before completing a disable sequence. If a downstream consumer applies backpressure for longer than 4 cycles, this timer will expire prematurely. This causes the logic to signal that the data pipeline is clear (`data_in_flight` becomes false), even though the FIFOs are still occupied. Consequently, the module's main enable signal (`enable_o`) is de-asserted, which can lead to a premature reset of the `entropy_src` core, flushing unprocessed entropy samples from the pipeline before they have been evaluated by the health tests.",

      "impact": "This flaw violates a critical security invariant of the entropy source: that all data from the noise source is processed by the health tests. Dropping entropy samples due to a premature shutdown can allow a faulty or biased physical random number generator (PTRNG) to go undetected. This degrades the quality of the entropy supplied to the system's cryptographic modules (like CSRNG), potentially weakening the security of all cryptographic operations that rely on this entropy.",
      "trigger_condition": "A system condition or a malicious actor can trigger this vulnerability by inducing a stall in the entropy data path that lasts longer than 4 clock cycles while simultaneously initiating a disable sequence. For instance, if the hardware consumer (e.g., CSRNG) is not ready to accept data, it will apply backpressure, causing the internal FIFOs to remain full. If software then disables the entropy source, the fixed timer will expire and the core will be reset, dropping the stalled, unprocessed entropy data.",
      "recommendations": "The shutdown logic should not rely on a fixed-size timer. The condition for extending the enable signal should be based solely on the actual state of the FIFOs. The `data_in_flight` signal should be redefined to depend only on the `fifos_not_empty` status. The logic should be changed from `assign data_in_flight = |fifo_timer_q && |fifos_not_empty;` to `assign data_in_flight = |fifos_not_empty;`. This ensures that the module waits indefinitely until the FIFOs are actually empty, preserving the integrity of the data pipeline. A system-level watchdog timer should be used to detect and handle cases of permanent, unrecoverable stalls, rather than implementing a short, fixed timeout at this low level."
