      "description": "The `FW_OV_SHA3_START` register, which is used to initiate the conditioning of firmware-injected data, is not protected by the main register write-enable lock (`regwen`). While other critical configuration registers in the module (e.g., `CONF`, `FW_OV_CONTROL`) are correctly gated by the `regwen_qs` signal to prevent modification after initial setup, the write enable for `FW_OV_SHA3_START` lacks this protection. This oversight allows the register to be written to at any time, bypassing a critical security lockdown mechanism.",
      "location": "entropy_src_reg_top.sv:2245-2264, 3678",
      "code_snippet": "\n// The register instantiation does not use a gated write-enable.\n// It is connected directly to fw_ov_sha3_start_we.\nprim_subreg #(\n  .DW      (4),\n  .SwAccess(prim_subreg_pkg::SwAccessRW),\n  .RESVAL  (4'h9),\n  .Mubi    (1'b1)\n) u_fw_ov_sha3_start (\n  .clk_i   (clk_i),\n  .rst_ni  (rst_ni),\n\n  // from register interface\n  .we     (fw_ov_sha3_start_we),\n  .wd     (fw_ov_sha3_start_wd),\n  ...\n);\n\n// The write-enable signal is generated without being AND-ed with regwen_qs.\nassign fw_ov_sha3_start_we = addr_hit[45] & reg_we & !reg_error;\n\n// For comparison, other critical registers like fw_ov_control are correctly gated:\n// assign fw_ov_control_gated_we = fw_ov_control_we & regwen_qs;\n",
      "impact": "An attacker with register write privileges can trigger the `fw_ov_sha3_start` command even after the main registers have been locked by software clearing `regwen`. This could be exploited to disrupt the normal operation of the entropy source by starting a SHA-3 operation on an empty or partially filled firmware override buffer. This can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) for consumers of entropy or the injection of non-validated data into the conditioning stage, undermining the integrity of the entropy generation process.",
      "trigger_condition": "A malicious or compromised software agent with access to the entropy_src memory-mapped registers performs a write to the `FW_OV_SHA3_START` register address (offset 0x94) after the `regwen` bit has been cleared to lock down other configuration registers.",
      "recommendations": "The write enable signal for the `FW_OV_SHA3_START` register must be gated with `regwen_qs`, consistent with other security-critical configuration registers. A new gated write-enable signal should be created and used for the register instance, for example:\n\nlogic fw_ov_sha3_start_gated_we;\nassign fw_ov_sha3_start_gated_we = fw_ov_sha3_start_we & regwen_qs;\n\nThen, connect `fw_ov_sha3_start_gated_we` to the `.we` input of the `u_fw_ov_sha3_start` module instance."

      "description": "The revision and identification register (`REV`) fields, including `abi_revision`, `hw_revision`, and `chip_type`, are hardcoded to constant values directly in the register top module. These values are not parameterized, preventing them from being easily updated during different stages of the design lifecycle (e.g., for new IP versions or different chip integrations).",
      "location": "entropy_src_reg_top.sv:801-813",
      "code_snippet": "\n// R[rev]: V(False)\n//   F[abi_revision]: 7:0\n// constant-only read\nassign rev_abi_revision_qs = 8'h3;\n\n//   F[hw_revision]: 15:8\n// constant-only read\nassign rev_hw_revision_qs = 8'h3;\n\n//   F[chip_type]: 23:16\n// constant-only read\nassign rev_chip_type_qs = 8'h1;\n",
      "impact": "This poses a security risk related to patchability and system identification. If a security vulnerability is discovered in a specific hardware revision, software relies on the `hw_revision` register to identify the affected hardware and apply necessary software workarounds or mitigations. If this value is not updated in a bug-fix revision of the IP, software will be unable to distinguish between the flawed and fixed hardware versions. This could lead to the failure to apply critical security patches in software, leaving the system vulnerable.",
      "trigger_condition": "A security vulnerability is found in this IP, and a new hardware revision is created to fix it. However, because the revision number is hardcoded, both the old and new hardware report the same version, preventing software from activating a necessary workaround on the old hardware.",
      "recommendations": "The hardcoded values for the `REV` register fields should be replaced with `localparam` or `parameter` definitions. These parameters should be defined at the top level of the module and should ideally be driven from a centralized package or build-time configuration file, ensuring that they can be easily and reliably updated for each new version or integration of the IP."
