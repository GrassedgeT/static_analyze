If the destination FIFO is full, the FSM will still transition to its next state, but the `main_stage_push_o` signal will be ignored by the full FIFO. This results in the silent loss of an entire block of entropy.",

      "impact": "Denial of Service. Cryptographic modules like CSRNG that depend on this entropy will stall or fail, as they will not receive the data they expect. The system may believe entropy has been generated and delivered when it has actually been dropped, leading to a system-wide cryptographic failure.",

      "recommendations": "Introduce a `main_stage_rdy_i` input signal to the FSM to indicate that the destination FIFO can accept data. The FSM should only assert `main_stage_push_o` and transition out of the `BootPostHTChk` and `Sha3Done` states when this `main_stage_rdy_i` signal is asserted."

      "description": "If both firmware override mode (`fw_ov_ent_insert_i`) and conditioner bypass mode (`bypass_mode_i`) are enabled, the FSM intentionally transitions back to the `Idle` state. This creates a silent deadlock condition where the entropy source produces no data and generates no errors or alerts.

      "recommendations": "The combination of firmware override and conditioner bypass should be treated as an illegal state. Instead of silently returning to `Idle`, the FSM should transition to the `Error` state and trigger a fatal alert to the alert handler.

This completely restarts the boot-time entropy sequence. This can lead to an infinite loop if the noise source is persistently faulty.",

It should discard the failing data and attempt to collect a new window of data without resetting the entire boot process.
