      "description": "The write-enable logic for critical configuration registers, `es_hw_regwen`, is controlled by a software-writable register `reg2hw.sw_regupd.q`. There is no hardware-enforced, one-time lock mechanism. This allows software with sufficient privileges to disable the module, modify sensitive settings (such as FIPS mode, data routing, or health test thresholds), and then re-enable the module at any time. This fundamentally undermines the security guarantees of the hardware, as security features can be disabled long after the secure boot phase.",

      "impact": "An attacker with register write access can bypass all of the module's security features by re-enabling register writes at runtime. This can lead to entropy leakage, use of weakened or non-compliant entropy, or a complete denial-of-service.",
      "trigger_condition": "A compromised software entity with access to the entropy_src registers writes to `SW_REGUPD` to enable updates, then to `MODULE_ENABLE` to disable the core, changes a critical configuration register, and finally re-enables the core.",
      "recommendations": "Implement a hardware-based register lock mechanism. A dedicated, one-way `LOCK` register should be added. Once trusted software writes to this register after initial configuration, the `es_hw_regwen` signal should be permanently forced to '0' until the next hardware reset, preventing any further modification of critical configuration registers."

      "description": "The module allows routing of the final conditioned entropy to a software-readable register (`ENTROPY_DATA`) based on the `es_route_to_sw` signal. This signal is derived directly from the `ENTROPY_CONTROL.es_route` register field, which is a software-writable register. While access to read the `ENTROPY_DATA` register is gated by an OTP fuse, the ability to *reroute* the data from the hardware path (e.g., to CSRNG) to the software path is not protected by a similar hardware lock.",

      "recommendations": "The `ENTROPY_CONTROL` register should be protected by the recommended hardware register lock. The decision to route entropy to software should be a boot-time configuration that is locked before any untrusted software executes. Runtime changes to this critical data path should not be permitted."

      "description": "The SHA-3 conditioner, a primary security feature, can be completely bypassed based on the state of software-configurable registers. The `es_bypass_mode` signal, which controls a multiplexer selecting between conditioned and unconditioned entropy, is true if FIPS mode is disabled or if both `es_bypass_to_sw` and `es_route_to_sw` are enabled. All of these controlling signals originate from software-writable registers (`CONF` and `ENTROPY_CONTROL`).",

This significantly reduces the cryptographic strength of the random data, making it more susceptible to prediction or influence if the physical noise source has subtle, non-ideal characteristics that the health tests do not detect. This constitutes a violation of CWE-1241.",

The system should be designed to operate in a single, secure mode (e.g., FIPS mode enabled) during normal operation.

While this feature is gated by an OTP fuse (`otp_en_entropy_src_fw_over_i`), if this fuse is enabled on a production device, it creates a powerful backdoor.

      "description": "A disable/enable cycle of the module without a full hardware reset does not explicitly reset the internal state of the `sha3` conditioner instance. The design relies on command-level controls (`sha3_start`, `sha3_process`) from the main FSM and complex masking logic (`sha3_flush_q`, `sha3_start_mask_q`) to manage the conditioner's state. This is less robust than a direct hardware reset and could potentially lead to state-carryover attacks, where residual data in the SHA-3 sponge from a previous operation is combined with new data, violating the integrity of the conditioning process.",

      "recommendations": "The `sha3` conditioner and its associated data FIFOs (`pfifo_precon`, `pfifo_bypass`) should be explicitly reset not only by `rst_ni` but also by a pulse generated upon module re-enable (e.g., `module_en_pulse_fo`). This ensures that every entropy generation sequence starts with the conditioner in a clean, known-good state, eliminating the possibility of state-carryover."
