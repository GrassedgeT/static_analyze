      "description": "The internal registers that store sensitive cryptographic state (`state_q`, `key_full_q`, `key_dec_q`) are reset to a constant value of all zeros on an asynchronous reset. This behavior contradicts the design's security policy of wiping sensitive registers with pseudo-random data, which is only performed under FSM control. An asynchronous reset bypasses this secure clearing mechanism.",

      "impact": "Forcing the device into reset sets the internal state to a known, low-entropy value (all zeros) instead of a random one. This is a weaker security posture and could aid certain attacks. If a reset is triggered mid-operation, sensitive intermediate state is not securely wiped, potentially leading to data remanence if the reset is imperfect or can be precisely controlled by an attacker.",
      "trigger_condition": "An attacker or system event that can trigger the top-level asynchronous reset `rst_ni` of the module.",
      "recommendations": "The reset logic for sensitive registers should be modified to ensure a secure wipe is performed. This can be achieved by making the reset synchronous and having the reset handler in the control FSM transition to a dedicated clearing state. This state would load pseudo-random data from `prd_clearing_state_i` and `prd_clearing_key_i` into the registers before the FSM proceeds to its normal idle state."

A sophisticated fault injection attack could potentially bypass the control logic (e.g., the `round_key_mux`) and force the core to use the output of this block. This would undermine the `CiphOpFwdOnly` security guarantee and could enable unauthorized decryption-related operations.",
      "trigger_condition": "The IP is synthesized with the `CiphOpFwdOnly` parameter set to 1. An attacker with physical access could use fault injection (e.g., laser or clock glitching) to corrupt the `round_key_sel` signal and activate the latent decryption logic.",

The design allows for insecure configurations where masking (`SecMasking=1`) is enabled but an unmasked S-Box implementation (e.g., `SBoxImplLut`) is selected. The `ASSERT_INIT` check for this condition is a simulation-only construct and does not prevent the synthesis of a vulnerable configuration.",

Instead of relying on simulation assertions, use `generate if` statements to conditionally instantiate different versions of `aes_sub_bytes` and `aes_key_expand`. For example, if `SecMasking` is true, the generate block should only contain instantiations that use a masked S-Box implementation, causing a synthesis error for invalid combinations."
