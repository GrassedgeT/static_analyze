      "description": "The signal `error_s`, used to generate the error flags `err_update` and `err_storage`, is declared but never assigned a value. In SystemVerilog, an uninitialized 'logic' type signal defaults to 'X' (unknown). When a mismatch condition occurs, 'X' is assigned to `err_update` or `err_storage`. This 'X' value propagates to the write-enable logic and control flow, failing to trigger the intended fail-safe mechanisms (like locking out writes or clearing the phase). Instead, it can lead to unpredictable behavior, potential state corruption, and denial of service, completely undermining the fault detection and security purpose of the module.",

/*Line78*/:   logic error_s;

/*Line185*/:   assign err_update  = (~staged_q != wr_data) ? error_s : 1'b0;
/*Line186*/:   assign err_storage = (~shadow_q != committed_q) ? error_s : 1'b0;
      ",
      "impact": "A fault injection attack (e.g., glitching a flip-flop) or an inconsistent software write, which are the exact scenarios this module is designed to protect against, will cause the module to enter an undefined state. Instead of safely locking the register, the 'X' propagation to write-enable signals can corrupt the register value, cause metastability in downstream logic, or result in a denial of service. The core security feature of the module is non-functional and its failure mode is insecure.",
      "trigger_condition": "An attacker can trigger this vulnerability by inducing a single-bit fault in either the `committed_q` or `shadow_q` flip-flops (e.g., via voltage/clock glitching or laser fault injection). This creates a mismatch that triggers the `err_storage` condition. Alternatively, a malicious software driver could perform two consecutive writes with different data, triggering the `err_update` condition. In both cases, the uninitialized `error_s` signal is used, leading to 'X' propagation.",
      "recommendations": "The uninitialized signal `error_s` should be removed. The assignments for `err_update` and `err_storage` should be simplified to directly assign the result of the comparison. This ensures that a mismatch results in a clean logic '1' on the error signals, properly activating the intended security lock-out mechanisms.\n\nReplace:\n`assign err_update  = (~staged_q != wr_data) ? error_s : 1'b0;`\n`assign err_storage = (~shadow_q != committed_q) ? error_s : 1'b0;`\n\nWith:\n`assign err_update  = (~staged_q != wr_data);`\n`assign err_storage = (~shadow_q != committed_q);`"
