      "description": "The module includes a static assertion `ASSERT_INIT(AddrImpliesEnable_A, AddrCheck && EnableCheck || !AddrCheck)` which forces the `EnableCheck` feature to be active whenever the `AddrCheck` feature is used. These two checks are logically independent: `AddrCheck` validates the one-hot signal against an address, while `EnableCheck` validates it against a separate enable signal. Forcing them to be coupled complicates the module's integration, as users who only need `AddrCheck` must configure a workaround for `EnableCheck` (e.g., setting `StrictCheck=0` and tying `en_i` high). This complexity can lead to misconfiguration and potentially mask real hardware errors.",

      "impact": "This design constraint can lead to incorrect integration of the primitive. An integrator forced into a non-obvious configuration may misconfigure the inputs, potentially masking real error conditions that the checker is intended to catch, or creating spurious errors that may be ignored over time. This weakens the security guarantee provided by the checker.",
      "trigger_condition": "An engineer attempts to instantiate the module with `AddrCheck=1` and `EnableCheck=0`, which is a valid use case for checking a one-hot signal's consistency against an address without reference to an external enable. The static assertion will cause a compilation failure, forcing the engineer to implement a potentially error-prone workaround.",
      "recommendations": "Remove the `AddrImpliesEnable_A` static assertion to allow `AddrCheck` and `EnableCheck` to be used independently. Update the documentation to clearly explain the function of each check and guide the user on appropriate configurations."

    {
      "description": "The SystemVerilog Assertion (SVA) for the address check, `AddrCheck_A`, performs a direct array access `oh_i[addr_i]`. If the value of `addr_i` is greater than or equal to `OneHotWidth`, this constitutes an out-of-bounds memory access in the context of the assertion. In simulation, this will evaluate to an `X` (unknown) value, which can cause the assertion to be vacuously true, false, or unknown, depending on the simulator. This creates a verification gap, as the assertion does not accurately model the synthesized hardware's behavior for out-of-bounds addresses.",
      "location": "prim_onehot_check.sv:133",
      "code_snippet": "\n`ASSERT(AddrCheck_A, oh_i[addr_i] != (|oh_i) |-> err_o)\n",
      "impact": "A verification gap is created where the behavior of the address check logic is not reliably checked for out-of-bounds `addr_i` values. A subtle hardware bug related to the handling of out-of-bounds addresses could be missed during pre-silicon verification, potentially allowing an attacker to bypass the address check under specific conditions. For example, if the hardware incorrectly handled an out-of-bounds address and failed to raise an error, this faulty assertion would not detect it.",
      "trigger_condition": "A simulation or formal verification test case where `AddrCheck` is enabled and `addr_i` is driven with a value greater than or equal to `OneHotWidth`.",
      "recommendations": "Modify the assertion to safely handle out-of-bounds addresses and accurately reflect the hardware implementation. The `and_tree` logic effectively treats out-of-bounds accesses as returning '0'. The assertion should be updated to model this behavior, for example: `ASSERT(AddrCheck_A, (addr_i < OneHotWidth ? oh_i[addr_i] : 1'b0) != (|oh_i) |-> err_o)`. This ensures the assertion correctly verifies the hardware's behavior across the entire input range of `addr_i`."
