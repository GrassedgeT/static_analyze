      "description": "The DMI-to-TLUL adapter for the JTAG access path does not generate bus integrity bits for write transactions. The `wdata_intg_i` input is hardcoded to zero, which means that fault injection attacks on JTAG-initiated writes to critical life cycle registers go undetected. This is a critical weakness, as the main system bus interface is protected by this mechanism, but the privileged JTAG debug path is not.",

A successful bit-flip could lead to an unauthorized state transition or bypass token authentication, resulting in a full security compromise.",
      "trigger_condition": "An attacker with JTAG access initiates a write to a life cycle register. Simultaneously, they apply a physical fault injection attack targeting the data bus between the JTAG DMI adapter and the life cycle register file.",
      "recommendations": "The JTAG access path must have the same level of protection as the primary CPU bus path. The `tlul_adapter_host` should be configured to generate integrity bits for write data, and this value should be connected to the `wdata_intg_i` input. The `u_reg_tap` register file instance should then be configured to validate the integrity of incoming writes."

An attacker who can monitor the `lc_flash_rma_seed_o` signals (e.g., through physical probing or a software bug in a connected module) can learn a portion of the secret RMA token.

They then command a new, real transition that is designed to fail. The `trans_success_q` bit is not cleared at the start of this new transition and remains 1 even after the failure, misleading any software that polls the status.",
      "recommendations": "The logic for clearing sticky status bits should be straightforward. The `trans_success_q` bit should be cleared unconditionally whenever a new transition is commanded via `transition_cmd`.
