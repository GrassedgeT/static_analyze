      "description": "The Finite State Machine's (FSM) default case, which is intended to catch illegal or undefined states, fails to assert the dedicated error signal 'fsm_err_o'. The line of code responsible for asserting this signal is commented out, preventing the module from notifying the system of a critical fault condition.",
      "location": "keymgr_data_en_state.sv:128",
      "code_snippet": "
/*Line127*/:       default: begin
/*Line128*/:         //fsm_err_o = 1'b1;
/*Line129*/: 	state_d = StCtrlDataDis;
/*Line130*/:       end
      ",
      "impact": "If a fault injection attack (e.g., voltage glitching, laser fault injection) or a single-event upset forces the FSM into an illegal state, the event will go completely undetected by the system's alert handler. This violates the 'fail-secure' principle, as the system is unaware that its integrity has been compromised. An attacker could repeatedly attempt fault attacks without triggering any countermeasures, significantly increasing the chances of a successful exploit.",
      "trigger_condition": "An attacker using a physical fault injection method or a radiation-induced event corrupts the FSM state register `state_q` to hold an un-encoded value not defined in the `state_e` enumeration, causing the `default` case to be executed.",
      "recommendations": "Uncomment the line `fsm_err_o = 1'b1;` within the `default` case. This will ensure that any entry into an illegal FSM state is immediately reported, allowing the system to take appropriate defensive actions, such as triggering an alert, wiping secrets, or resetting the device."

    {
      "description": "Upon entering an illegal state, the FSM transitions to `StCtrlDataDis`, which is a standard, recoverable operational state. This design allows the FSM to automatically recover from a critical fault condition and return to the idle state after the current operation completes. A secure FSM should instead transition to a terminal, non-recoverable error state.",
      "location": "keymgr_data_en_state.sv:129",
      "code_snippet": "
/*Line127*/:       default: begin
/*Line128*/:         //fsm_err_o = 1'b1;
/*Line129*/: 	state_d = StCtrlDataDis;
/*Line130*/:       end
      ",
      "impact": "This recoverable error handling allows a transient fault attack to potentially bypass security checks (e.g., briefly enabling a key output when it should be disabled) without causing a permanent denial of service or leaving a persistent error flag. The module returns to a normal operating state, effectively hiding the evidence of the attack. This makes transient fault attacks more practical and harder to detect, as the system's integrity can be compromised without any lasting, observable evidence.",
      "trigger_condition": "An attacker uses a precisely timed fault injection attack to force the FSM state register `state_q` into an un-encoded value. The FSM logic transitions to the `StCtrlDataDis` state. The ongoing hardware operation then completes normally, causing the FSM to sequence through `StCtrlDataWait` and back to `StCtrlDataIdle`, erasing the evidence of the illegal state.",
      "recommendations": "The `default` case should transition the FSM to a dedicated, terminal error state from which it cannot recover without a system reset. The existing but unused `StCtrlDataInvalid` state should be used for this purpose. The line `state_d = StCtrlDataDis;` should be changed to `state_d = StCtrlDataInvalid;`. Furthermore, ensure that the `StCtrlDataInvalid` state has no exit transitions, effectively locking the module in a safe state upon fault detection."
