The logic only monitors for valid transitions into the main operational states (StCtrlRootKey, StCtrlCreatorRootKey, StCtrlOwnerIntKey, StCtrlOwnerKey) and flags an error if they occur without an 'advance' command. However, it fails to monitor transitions into terminal or error states like StCtrlDisabled, StCtrlWipe, or StCtrlInvalid. This omission creates a blind spot in the security monitoring.",

This includes transitions to `StCtrlDisabled`, `StCtrlWipe`, and `StCtrlInvalid`, ensuring that they only occur under the correct, expected conditions (e.g., a `dis_op` command for `StCtrlDisabled`, or a detected fault for `StCtrlWipe`)."

      "recommendations": "When an invalid stage is selected, the key material provided to the KMAC should not be a replicated, low-entropy value. Instead, it should be a cryptographically safe value, such as a constant all-zeros or all-ones pattern, or a freshly generated random number that is not replicated. This prevents the use of a weak key in any cryptographic operation."
