      "description": "The data blanking mechanism for the IMEM and DMEM bus interfaces is incorrectly implemented. The enable signals for the `prim_blanker` modules (`imem_rdata_bus_en_q` and `dmem_rdata_bus_en_q`) are hardcoded to a constant value of '1'. A '1' on the blanker's enable input causes it to pass data through, effectively disabling the blanking feature. This contradicts the design's intent, as described in the comments, to prevent data leakage while the core is executing.",

      "impact": "This flaw creates a significant side-channel vulnerability (CWE-208). It allows an attacker with bus access to read the instruction stream from IMEM and data from DMEM while the OTBN core is performing sensitive cryptographic operations. This leakage breaks the execution isolation security boundary, potentially exposing secret keys, intermediate values, or details about the algorithm's execution flow.",
      "trigger_condition": "An attacker performs a read operation on the TL-UL bus to an address within the IMEM or DMEM range while the OTBN core is in an execution state (e.g., `StatusBusyExecute`). The supposedly blanked read data will instead contain the sensitive information being accessed by the core.",
      "recommendations": "The blanker enable signals must be controlled dynamically. They should be de-asserted (driven to '0') whenever the core is accessing the memory or is in a locked state. The logic should be changed from `assign imem_rdata_bus_en_d = 1'b1;` to something like `assign imem_rdata_bus_en_d = ~imem_access_core & ~locking;`. The same correction is needed for `dmem_rdata_bus_en_d` using `dmem_access_core`."

      "impact": "This vulnerability completely bypasses the DMEM integrity protection, a critical security feature against fault injection attacks. An attacker can use physical means (e.g., voltage glitching, laser fault injection) to corrupt data in DMEM without detection. This could lead to silent data corruption, resulting in incorrect cryptographic outputs, leakage of secret keys, or bypassing security-critical checks within the OTBN program.",

      "recommendations": "The logic must be corrected to propagate the detected error. First, the `dmem_rerror_vec` assignment should incorporate the `dmem_rerror_raw` signal, e.g., `assign dmem_rerror_vec[i_word*2 +: 2] = dmem_rerror_raw & {2{dmem_rmask_core_q[i_word] & dmem_rvalid & dmem_access_core}};`. Second, the `dmem_rerror` signal must be derived from this vector instead of being hardcoded, e.g., `assign dmem_rerror = |dmem_rerror_vec;`."

The entire register is cleared to zero if a write occurs to the `bad_data_addr` field, rather than adhering to the Write-1-to-Clear (W1C) behavior where only bits written with '1' are cleared.

If an operation results in multiple error bits being set (e.g., `illegal_insn` and `fatal_software`), a subsequent write by attacker-controlled software to just the `bad_data_addr` bit will clear all error flags. This prevents legitimate host software from correctly diagnosing the failure, potentially allowing an attack to go unnoticed or be misattributed.",

      "recommendations": "The register clearing logic should be implemented to meet the W1C standard for all fields. Instead of a single `err_bits_clear` signal, the next state for each bit in `err_bits_q` should be calculated based on a write to that specific bit. A correct implementation would look something like `err_bits_d = err_bits_q & ~reg2hw.err_bits.q;`, where the update is enabled by `reg2hw.err_bits.qe` (representing a write to the register as a whole) and `is_not_running_q`."
