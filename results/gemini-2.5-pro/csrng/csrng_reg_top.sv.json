      "description": "The `RESEED_INTERVAL` register, which controls how often the DRBG must be reseeded with new entropy, is not protected by the `regwen` register lock. This allows its value to be changed at any time, even after the primary configuration registers (like `CTRL`) have been locked.",

assign reseed_interval_we = addr_hit[7] & reg_we & !reg_error;
      ",
      "impact": "A high security impact. An attacker with write access to the CSRNG register space can set the reseed interval to a very large value. This weakens the cryptographic security of the generator by reducing the frequency of reseeding, making the output more susceptible to cryptographic analysis and prediction over time, especially if a large amount of random data is requested.",
      "trigger_condition": "Malicious software with access to the CSRNG's memory-mapped registers writes a large value to the `RESEED_INTERVAL` register at offset `0x1c`.",
      "recommendations": "The write enable for the `RESEED_INTERVAL` register should be gated by the `regwen_qs` signal, similar to how the `CTRL` register is protected. This ensures that the reseed interval can only be configured before the registers are locked. The line should be changed to: `assign reseed_interval_we = addr_hit[7] & reg_we & !reg_error & regwen_qs;`"

      "description": "The `read_int_state` field within the `CTRL` register has an insecure default reset value. It is initialized to `4'h9`, which corresponds to the multi-bit 'true' value. This field is one of two locks that must be enabled to allow reading the secret internal state (key and V) of the DRBG. By defaulting to 'true', this critical security protection is partially defeated at reset.",

An attacker only needs to bypass the second lock (`INT_STATE_READ_ENABLE` register) to read out the DRBG's secret state. A successful attack would allow prediction of all past and future random numbers generated by the module.",
      "trigger_condition": "The vulnerability is present from reset. An attacker can exploit it by gaining write access to the `INT_STATE_READ_ENABLE` register (offset `0x38`), enabling it, and then reading the internal state via the `INT_STATE_VAL` register.",
      "recommendations": "The reset value (`RESVAL`) for the `u_ctrl_read_int_state` sub-register should be changed from `4'h9` (TRUE) to `4'h6` (FALSE). This would ensure the feature is disabled by default, adhering to the principle of least privilege and defense-in-depth."
