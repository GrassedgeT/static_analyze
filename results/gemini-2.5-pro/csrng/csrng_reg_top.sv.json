      "description": "The primary register write-enable lock, `REGWEN`, fails to protect several critical configuration and command registers. Registers such as `CMD_REQ` (command request), `RESEED_INTERVAL`, `INTR_ENABLE`, and `INT_STATE_NUM` can be written to even after `REGWEN` is cleared to '0'. This violates the intended hardware security policy of locking the module's configuration after initial setup.",

This could involve issuing unauthorized commands (e.g., `uninstantiate`), changing the reseed interval to weaken security, creating denial-of-service conditions by enabling interrupts, or manipulating the internal state read pointer to assist in state leakage attacks.",

Specifically, the write enables `cmd_req_we`, `reseed_interval_we`, `intr_enable_we`, and `int_state_num_we` should be logically ANDed with `regwen_qs`."
