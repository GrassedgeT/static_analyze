      "description": "The main state machine can enter a deadlock state, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS). If a new SPI write transaction begins while the command FIFO (`cmdaddr_buffer`) is not empty, the FSM transitions from `StAddr` to `StWait`. The condition to exit `StWait` for a write command requires the command FIFO to be empty (`~|sck_cmdaddr_wdepth`). Since the FIFO is not empty, this condition can never be met, causing the FSM to remain in `StWait` indefinitely and ignore the incoming transaction.",
