      "description": "The integrity and consistency check logic contains a bypass condition that treats a blank (all-zero) digest as a successful check. If a partition is provisioned with data but its digest is never written, all subsequent integrity checks will automatically pass without verifying the data. This also prevents the hardware-enforced write-lock, which is predicated on a non-zero digest, from engaging. This effectively nullifies the integrity protection and write-once guarantee for any partition where the digest is not provisioned.",

If a digest value of all zeros is a valid state for an unprovisioned partition, the FSM should handle this case explicitly by not unlocking the partition (i.e., `dout_locked_d` should not be set to `MuBi8False`) until a valid, non-zero digest is computed and verified."
