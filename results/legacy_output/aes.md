Based on my analysis of the `aes` IP module, I have identified several security vulnerabilities. Below is a detailed report of my findings.

### Summary of Findings

1.  **CWE-1254: Exposure of Debug Interface to Untrusted Control**: A critical debug feature, `SecAllowForcingMasks`, which allows for disabling the side-channel attack countermeasures (masking), is hardcoded as enabled in the top-level wrapper. This allows an attacker with bus access to disable masking by writing to a control register, rendering the device vulnerable to side-channel attacks for key extraction.
2.  **CWE-338: Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)**: The pseudo-random number generator used for clearing sensitive registers (`key`, `IV`) is based on a Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR). LFSRs are not cryptographically secure, and their output is predictable. This could potentially be exploited in advanced attack scenarios to gain information about the internal state of the device.

### Detailed Vulnerability Analysis

### 1. Hardcoded Debug Feature Enabling Masking Disable

- **Vulnerability:** CWE-1254: Exposure of Debug Interface to Untrusted Control
- **Severity:** Critical

#### Description

The `aes` module has a parameter `SecAllowForcingMasks` which is intended for debug and side-channel analysis. When enabled, it allows the masking scheme to be disabled by setting the `force_masks` bit in the `ctrl_aux_shadowed` register.

In the top-level `aes` module (`aes.sv`), this parameter is hardcoded to `1` when instantiating the `aes_core` module. This means the feature is always enabled in the hardware, regardless of any top-level configuration.

- **Line:** 180
- **Code Snippet:**
  ```systemverilog
  /*Line175*/:   aes_core #(
  /*Line176*/:     .AES192Enable             ( AES192Enable             ),
  /*Line177*/:     .SecMasking               ( SecMasking               ),
  /*Line178*/:     .SecSBoxImpl              ( SecSBoxImpl              ),
  /*Line179*/:     .SecStartTriggerDelay     ( SecStartTriggerDelay     ),
  /*Line180*/:     .SecAllowForcingMasks     ( 1     ), // <-- VULNERABILITY: Hardcoded to 1
  /*Line181*/:     .SecSkipPRNGReseeding     ( SecSkipPRNGReseeding     ),
  /*Line182*/:     .EntropyWidth             ( EntropyWidth             ),
  /*Line183*/:     .RndCnstClearingLfsrSeed  ( RndCnstClearingLfsrSeed  ),
  /*Line184*/:     .RndCnstClearingLfsrPerm  ( RndCnstClearingLfsrPerm  ),
  /*Line185*/:     .RndCnstClearingSharePerm ( RndCnstClearingSharePerm ),
  /*Line186*/:     .RndCnstMaskingLfsrSeed   ( RndCnstMaskingLfsrSeed   ),
  /*Line187*/:     .RndCnstMaskingLfsrPerm   ( RndCnstMaskingLfsrPerm   )
  /*Line188*/:   ) u_aes_core (
  ...
  ```

This parameter is then propagated down to the `aes_prng_masking` module which uses it to control the `allow_lockup_i` port of the `prim_trivium` PRNG.

- **Line:** 114
- **Code Snippet:**
  ```systemverilog
  /*Line112*/:   .en_i                (data_update_i),
  /*Line113*/:   .allow_lockup_i      (SecAllowForcingMasks & force_masks_i),
  /*Line114*/:   .seed_en_i           (prng_seed_en),
  ```

The `force_masks_i` signal is controlled by the `force_masks` field in the `ctrl_aux_shadowed` register, which is accessible from the TileLink bus interface.

- **File:** `hw/ip/aes/rtl/aes_core.sv`
- **Line:** 583
- **Code Snippet:**
  ```systemverilog
  /*Line582*/:   // Auxiliary control register signals
  /*Line583*/:   assign key_touch_forces_reseed = reg2hw.ctrl_aux_shadowed.key_touch_forces_reseed.q;
  /*Line584*/:   assign force_masks             = reg2hw.ctrl_aux_shadowed.force_masks.q;
  ```

#### Impact

An attacker with software access to the AES peripheral registers can write to the `ctrl_aux_shadowed` register to set the `force_masks` bit. This will disable the masking countermeasure, which is the primary protection against side-channel attacks. With masking disabled, an attacker can perform Differential Power Analysis (DPA) or other side-channel attacks to extract the secret AES key from the device. This completely undermines the hardware-level security provided by masking.

#### Trigger Condition

1.  An attacker gains the ability to write to the AES peripheral registers via the TileLink bus.
2.  The `ctrl_aux_regwen` register has not been locked (cleared) by software.
3.  The attacker writes to the `ctrl_aux_shadowed` register, setting the `force_masks` bit to `1`.
4.  The attacker initiates an AES operation and measures the device's power consumption or electromagnetic emissions to perform a side-channel attack.

### 2. Use of a Cryptographically Weak PRNG for Register Clearing

- **Vulnerability:** CWE-338: Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)
- **Severity:** Medium

#### Description

The `aes_prng_clearing` module is responsible for generating pseudo-random data used to wipe sensitive registers, such as the key and IV registers, when a clear operation is triggered. This module uses a `prim_lfsr`, which is a Linear Feedback Shift Register. LFSRs are known to be cryptographically weak PRNGs because their internal state can be easily predicted from a small number of output bits.

#### Location

- **File:** `hw/ip/aes/rtl/aes_prng_clearing.sv`
- **Line:** 101
- **Code Snippet:**
  ```systemverilog
  /*Line101*/:   prim_lfsr #(
  /*Line102*/:     .LfsrType     ( "GAL_XOR"       ),
  /*Line103*/:     .LfsrDw       ( Width           ),
  /*Line104*/:     .StateOutDw   ( Width           ),
  /*Line105*/:     .DefaultSeed  ( RndCnstLfsrSeed ),
  /*Line106*/:     .StatePermEn  ( 1'b1            ),
  /*Line107*/:     .StatePerm    ( RndCnstLfsrPerm ),
  /*Line108*/:     .NonLinearOut ( 1'b1            )
  /*Line109*/:   ) u_lfsr (
  /*Line110*/:     .clk_i     ( clk_i      ),
  /*Line111*/:     .rst_ni    ( rst_ni     ),
  /*Line112*/:     .seed_en_i ( seed_en    ),
  /*Line113*/:     .seed_i    ( seed       ),
  /*Line114*/:     .lfsr_en_i ( lfsr_en    ),
  /*Line115*/:     .entropy_i (         '0 ),
  /*Line116*/:     .state_o   ( lfsr_state )
  /*Line117*/:   );
  ```

This LFSR-generated data is then used in `aes_core.sv` to clear keying material.

- **File:** `hw/ip/aes/rtl/aes_core.sv`
- **Line:** 320
- **Code Snippet:**
  ```systemverilog
  /*Line317*/:     unique case (key_init_sel)
  /*Line318*/:       KEY_INIT_INPUT:  key_init_d = key_init;
  /*Line319*/:       KEY_INIT_KEYMGR: key_init_d = key_sideload;
  /*Line320*/:       KEY_INIT_CLEAR:  key_init_d = prd_clearing_key_init;
  /*Line321*/:       default:         key_init_d = prd_clearing_key_init;
  /*Line322*/:     endcase
  ```

#### Impact

While using pseudo-random data to clear registers is a good security practice (better than clearing to all zeros), the use of a weak PRNG (LFSR) is a potential vulnerability. If an attacker could, through some side-channel, observe the values used to clear the registers, they could potentially determine the state of the LFSR. This would allow them to predict all past and future clearing values. This knowledge could be leveraged in more complex attacks, for example, to subtract the "random" clearing noise from a side-channel trace to get a cleaner signal for another attack. The masking PRNG (`aes_prng_masking`) correctly uses a secure stream cipher (`prim_trivium`), and the clearing PRNG should be held to the same standard.

#### Trigger Condition

This is not directly exploitable but represents a weakness in the design's defense-in-depth. An attack would require:
1.  A physical side-channel attack vector to observe the values being written to the registers during a clear operation.
2.  The ability to use the predicted "random" values to aid another attack (e.g., DPA or a fault attack).
