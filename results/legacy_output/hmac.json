      "description": "Multiple flaws in the register read multiplexer logic allow an attacker with read access to the peripheral to exfiltrate the secret key. The KEY registers, intended to be write-only, will return key material when specific or unmapped addresses are read. Specifically: 1) Reading the `WIPE_SECRET` register returns `KEY_0`. 2) Reading any unmapped register address returns `KEY_2` due to an insecure default case.",

      "impact": "Complete compromise of the HMAC secret key. An attacker can read out key shares without any special privileges beyond access to the HMAC memory-mapped registers. This completely breaks the integrity and authentication guarantees provided by the HMAC module. This corresponds to CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor.",

      "recommendations": "The read multiplexer logic must be corrected immediately. All reads from addresses corresponding to write-only registers (including all KEY registers and WIPE_SECRET) must return a constant, non-sensitive value (e.g., 32'h0). The `default` case of the multiplexer must also be changed to return a constant value and should ideally flag an address error."

      "description": "The key wiping mechanism is gated by an error condition. The write enable for the `WIPE_SECRET` register (`wipe_secret_we`) is only asserted if a bus transaction error (`reg_error`) occurs simultaneously. This prevents legitimate software from reliably clearing the secret key under normal operating conditions.",

This prevents secure cleanup of sensitive material, leaving the key vulnerable to later extraction by other means (e.g., fault injection, side-channel attacks, or software vulnerabilities). This corresponds to CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure.",
      "trigger_condition": "A standard, valid software write to the `WIPE_SECRET` register address. Because the write is valid, `reg_error` is false, and the `wipe_secret_we` signal is never asserted, so the wipe command is ignored.",
