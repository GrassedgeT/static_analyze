Here is a security analysis of the `hmac` IP module.

### Summary of Analysis

I have analyzed the SystemVerilog RTL code for the `hmac` IP module, including the top-level module (`hmac.sv`), the core logic (`hmac_core.sv`), and the register interface (`hmac_reg_top.sv`). The analysis focused on identifying potential security vulnerabilities in the design, particularly concerning access control, information leakage, and the handling of cryptographic state.

The analysis has uncovered two critical vulnerabilities and one major design flaw. The most severe vulnerability allows for the direct readback of the secret key after it has been written to the hardware. The second issue is a flawed key-wiping mechanism that is unlikely to function as intended under normal operating conditions. Finally, a combinatorial loop was identified in the FIFO control logic, which represents a significant design flaw.

### Vulnerability Details

#### 1. [CWE-1275] Secret Key Readback

*   **Vulnerability ID:** HMAC-VULN-001
*   **Severity:** Critical
*   **Location:** `hmac_reg_top.sv`, lines 2416-2542
*   **Description:**
    The register top module (`hmac_reg_top`) contains a critical flaw in its read path logic. The read data multiplexer for the `KEY` registers incorrectly sources data from the `reg2hw` (register-to-hardware) bus instead of a secure, read-only path. The `reg2hw.key[i].q` signals hold the value of the secret key that has just been written by software. By reading the `KEY` register addresses, software can directly read back the secret key that is meant to be write-only.

*   **Code Snippet (`hmac_reg_top.sv`):**
    ```systemverilog
    /*Line2416*/:       addr_hit[9]: begin
    /*Line2417*/:         reg_rdata_next[31:0] = reg2hw.key[0].q;
    /*Line2418*/:       end
    /*Line2419*/:
    /*Line2420*/:       addr_hit[10]: begin
    /*Line2421*/:         reg_rdata_next[31:0] = reg2hw.key[1].q;
    /*Line2422*/:       end
    ```
    The read path for the key registers (e.g., when `addr_hit[9]` for `KEY_0` is true) is connected to `reg2hw.key[0].q`. This signal holds the value of the key that was written by the CPU and is intended only for the internal HMAC logic. The correct implementation would be to return a fixed value (e.g., zero) or tie the read data to a path that does not contain the secret.

*   **Impact:**
    This vulnerability completely compromises the security of the HMAC IP. Any software with access to the HMAC registers can write a key and then immediately read it back, exfiltrating the secret key. This defeats the purpose of having a hardware-backed MAC function, as the key is not securely contained within the hardware boundary.

*   **Trigger Condition:**
    An attacker with memory-mapped access to the HMAC registers can trigger this vulnerability by performing a write operation to any of the `KEY` registers, followed by a read operation to the same register address.

#### 2. [CWE-754] Flawed Secret Key Wiping Mechanism

*   **Vulnerability ID:** HMAC-VULN-002
*   **Severity:** High
*   **Location:** `hmac_reg_top.sv`, line 2122
*   **Description:**
    The mechanism to wipe the secret key and other sensitive internal states is critically flawed. The write-enable signal for the `WIPE_SECRET` command register (`wipe_secret_we`) is gated by the `reg_error` signal. The `reg_error` signal is only asserted when there is a bus access error, such as an integrity error, a write to an unmapped address (`addrmiss`), or a write with invalid byte enables (`wr_err`).

*   **Code Snippet (`hmac_reg_top.sv`):**
    ```systemverilog
    /*Line2122*/:   assign wipe_secret_we = addr_hit[8] & reg_we & reg_error;
    ```
    This logic dictates that a write to the `WIPE_SECRET` register is only successful if it occurs simultaneously with a bus error. Under normal, error-free conditions, it is impossible for software to trigger the key wiping function.

*   **Impact:**
    This flaw prevents software from reliably clearing the secret key from the hardware after use. The key will remain in the `secret_key` register and the internal state of the SHA core until a new key is loaded or the device is reset. This significantly increases the time window during which the key is exposed and could be vulnerable to other attacks, such as physical attacks, fault injection, or software exploits that gain access to the device.

*   **Trigger Condition:**
    This is a flaw in a security feature. It cannot be triggered by software under normal conditions. An attacker might be able to trigger it by intentionally causing a bus error while writing to the `WIPE_SECRET` address, but this is a non-standard and unreliable way to operate the hardware.

#### 3. Combinatorial Loop in FIFO Control Logic

*   **Vulnerability ID:** HMAC-FLAW-001
*   **Severity:** Medium
*   **Location:** `hmac.sv`, line 537
*   **Description:**
    The FIFO control logic in `hmac.sv` contains a combinatorial loop. The `fifo_wvalid` signal, which is the write-valid signal sent *to* the message FIFO, depends on `fifo_wready`, which is the ready signal coming *from* the same FIFO. A `valid` signal in a `valid/ready` handshake must not depend on its corresponding `ready` signal.

*   **Code Snippet (`hmac.sv`):**
    ```systemverilog
    /*Line537*/:   assign fifo_wvalid = (hmac_fifo_wsel && fifo_wready) ? hmac_fifo_wvalid : reg_fifo_wvalid;
    ```
    When the HMAC core is writing to the FIFO (`hmac_fifo_wsel` is high), `fifo_wvalid` becomes dependent on `fifo_wready`.

*   **Impact:**
    This design flaw can lead to unpredictable behavior and timing violations, especially after synthesis. While it might not result in a deadlock in the current implementation, it makes the design fragile and difficult to verify. Such loops can cause metastability issues and may lead to functional failures or security bypasses under specific timing conditions that are hard to predict. For instance, it could potentially disrupt the state machine in `hmac_core` that relies on this handshake, leading to incorrect HMAC computation.

*   **Trigger Condition:**
    This is a static design flaw that is present whenever the `hmac_core` FSM enters the `StPushToMsgFifo` state, which occurs during the normal HMAC computation process.

### Recommendations

1.  **HMAC-VULN-001 (Key Readback):** The read path for the `KEY` registers in `hmac_reg_top.sv` must be corrected immediately. The read multiplexer should be changed to return a constant value (e.g., `32'h0`) when any of the `KEY` register addresses are read. The `qs` outputs of the `u_key_*` instances should be left unconnected, and the read mux should not source data from `reg2hw.key`.

2.  **HMAC-VULN-002 (Key Wiping):** The logic for the `wipe_secret_we` signal in `hmac_reg_top.sv` must be fixed. The dependency on `reg_error` should be removed to allow for a direct, reliable software trigger. The line should be changed to:
    ```systemverilog
    assign wipe_secret_we = addr_hit[8] & reg_we & !reg_error;
    ```

3.  **HMAC-FLAW-001 (Combinatorial Loop):** The combinatorial loop in `hmac.sv` must be removed. The logic should be changed to a simple multiplexer that selects the valid signal based on the source (HMAC core or packer), independent of the ready signal. The line should be changed to:
    ```systemverilog
    assign fifo_wvalid = hmac_fifo_wsel ? hmac_fifo_wvalid : reg_fifo_wvalid;
    ```
