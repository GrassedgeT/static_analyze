Based on the comprehensive analysis of the HMAC module using the retrieved documentation, abstract syntax tree, and dependency information, I've generated the structured JSON output as required:

    "executive_summary": "The HMAC module is a SHA-2 hash-based authentication code generator that supports both HMAC and pure SHA-2 modes. It provides cryptographic integrity verification for messages using a secret key and supports SHA-256/384/512 algorithms with configurable key lengths up to 1024 bits. The module features a 32x32-bit message FIFO and context switching capabilities but is not hardened against side-channel or fault injection attacks.",
    "theory_of_operation": {
      "core_functionality": "The HMAC core converts the secret key into inner and outer padded keys. In HMAC mode, it performs two rounds of hashing: first with the inner key concatenated with the message, then with the outer key concatenated with the intermediate digest. In SHA-2 mode, it functions as a standard hash accelerator. The module handles endianness conversion and supports configurable digest sizes.",

      ],
      "data_flow": "Message data enters through the TL-UL interface and is stored in the message FIFO after endianness conversion. In HMAC mode, the inner padded key is prepended to the message for the first hash round. The resulting digest is then fed back into the FIFO, prepended with the outer padded key for the second hash round. Final digest results are stored in output registers."
