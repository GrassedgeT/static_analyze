    "executive_summary": "OTBN (OpenTitan Big Number Accelerator) is a specialized coprocessor for accelerating asymmetric cryptographic operations. It operates independently from the main CPU (Ibex), fetching its own instructions and data from dedicated instruction (IMEM) and data (DMEM) memories. This separation is designed to create a security boundary, protecting sensitive cryptographic operations and key material from the potentially compromised host processor. Interaction is primarily managed through a TileLink (TL-UL) interface for loading programs/data and controlling execution via memory-mapped registers.",

It has its own RISC-V based instruction set architecture (ISA) tailored for these tasks. It fetches instructions from a dedicated 8KiB IMEM and reads/writes data to a 4KiB DMEM. It is designed as a coprocessor that the main CPU tasks with specific jobs, waits for completion, and then retrieves the results.",

Dataflow logic shows complex multiplexing for memory access arbitration between the core and the bus (`imem_req` is assigned based on `imem_access_core`). Error logic is highly combinatorial, aggregating numerous error sources (`core_err_bits`, `non_core_err_bits`) into fatal alerts. This complexity, especially in state transitions (`status_d`) and error handling, presents a rich target for formal verification and fault injection analysis.",

These dependencies form a trusted computing base. A vulnerability in any of these upstream modules could undermine OTBN's security guarantees.
