Based on the comprehensive analysis of the lc_ctrl module in OpenTitan, here's the structured JSON report:

    "executive_summary": "The Life Cycle Controller (lc_ctrl) manages critical device lifecycle states and transitions, enforcing security policies through state machines, token validation, and hardware-enforced access controls. It handles irreversible transitions between states like PROD, DEV, TEST, and RMA while protecting sensitive operations like OTP programming and token validation.",
    "theory_of_operation": {

Core operations include: 1) Decoding current lifecycle state from OTP, 2) Validating transition tokens via KMAC hashing, 3) Programming new states to OTP after validation, 4) Broadcasting security-critical signals to other IPs. State transitions are linear and glitch-resistant by design.",
