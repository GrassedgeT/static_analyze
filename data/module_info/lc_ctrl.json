    "executive_summary": "The Life Cycle Controller (lc_ctrl) is a critical IP module responsible for managing the security state and life cycle of the OpenTitan device. It controls transitions between different life cycle states (e.g., RAW, TEST, DEV, PROD, RMA), enforces access control policies based on the current state, and protects critical device secrets. Its operation is primarily based on a hardware finite state machine (FSM) that advances through states based on commands and cryptographic tokens.",
    "theory_of_operation": {
      "core_functionality": "The lc_ctrl module's primary function is to securely manage the device's life cycle. It reads the current state from One-Time Programmable (OTP) memory, processes state transition requests from software, and writes the new state back to OTP. State transitions are irreversible and are protected by unlock tokens, which are hashed using KMAC before comparison. The controller also generates a set of broadcasted signals that enable or disable features across the chip (like JTAG, memory access, etc.) based on the current life cycle state.",

It is designed to be a linear state machine that only moves forward (e.g., from DEV to PROD), making it difficult to revert to a less secure state through glitches or faults. The FSM state is redundantly encoded for reliability. It sequences operations for a state transition, including token verification, interaction with the flash controller for RMA (Return Merchandise Authorization) requests, and programming the next state into OTP memory.",

For token-protected transitions, the provided token is sent to the KMAC interface (`lc_ctrl_kmac_if`) to be hashed. The resulting hash is then compared against the expected hash value read from OTP. Based on the comparison result and command, the FSM decides whether to program the next life cycle state into the OTP macro. The current state is read from OTP and broadcasted to other IPs."
