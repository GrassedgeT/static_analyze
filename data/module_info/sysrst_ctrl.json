    "executive_summary": "The sysrst_ctrl module is responsible for handling system reset controls and keyboard/button inputs. It monitors specific input pins, detects combination key presses (combos), and triggers actions like interrupts, EC reset, or OpenTitan reset requests. A key feature is the ability for software to override the output pins, allowing the security chip to take control of signals from the main host. Its functionality is primarily configured through a set of registers accessible via a TileLink-UL bus interface.",
    "theory_of_operation": {
      "core_functionality": "The core functionality of sysrst_ctrl involves monitoring four input pins (pwrb_in_i, key[0,1,2]_in_i) and their corresponding output pins. It can pass the input signals directly to the outputs, with an option to invert them. The module can be configured to detect specific combinations of these inputs being active for a programmable duration. Upon detection, it can trigger various actions, such as generating an interrupt, issuing an EC reset, or requesting a system reset. The module also features an override mechanism where software can control the state of the output pins, decoupling them from the input pins.",

These inputs first go through an optional inversion stage controlled by the `KEY_INVERT_CTL` register. The potentially inverted signals are then processed by debounce and detection logic (`sysrst_ctrl_detect`, `sysrst_ctrl_keyintr`, `sysrst_ctrl_combo`). This logic is configured by multiple registers (e.g., `ULP_*_DEBOUNCE_CTL`, `COM_*_CTL_*`). Based on detection, the module can generate interrupts or hardware requests (`rst_req_o`). The data flow for output pins (e.g., `cio_pwrb_out_o`) can either be a pass-through of the (inverted) input signal or can be overridden by software values set in the `PIN_OUT_VALUE` register, if enabled by `PIN_OUT_CTL`."

The `sysrst_ctrl_detect` module is instantiated multiple times within other modules (`sysrst_ctrl_ulp`, `sysrst_ctrl_keyintr`, `sysrst_ctrl_combo`), indicating its central role as a generic event detection engine. The dataflow models in `sysrst_ctrl.sv` confirm that external pin inputs (`cio_*_i`) are XORed with values from the `key_invert_ctl` register before being used, implementing the inversion feature. The final output signals are determined by a combination of hardware state and software-controlled override registers.

The top-level register module, `sysrst_ctrl_reg_top`, depends on `tlul_adapter_reg`, which solidifies the TL-UL bus as the main software interface.
