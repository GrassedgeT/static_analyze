    "executive_summary": "The GPIO module provides 32 configurable general-purpose I/O pins with flexible input/output control, interrupt generation capabilities, and hardware-level security features.

  "abstract_syntax_tree_summary": "The GPIO implementation consists of two main modules: gpio_reg_top (register interface) and gpio (core functionality). The register interface uses TileLink with integrity checking (tlul_cmd_intg_chk) and implements 23 register instances through prim_subreg and prim_subreg_ext. The core module features interrupt handling (prim_intr_hw), input filtering (prim_filter_ctr), and alert generation (prim_alert_sender). Key logic includes: 1) 15+ always blocks handling register updates and data flow, 2) Masked write implementation splitting registers into data and mask components, 3) Interrupt generation through edge/level detection logic comparing current and previous input states. Complex expressions handle error conditions (intg_err_o = err_q | intg_err | reg_we_err) and register access control (addrmiss = (reg_re || reg_we) ? ~|addr_hit : 1'b0).",
  "dependency_summary": "The GPIO module depends on several security-critical components: tlul_cmd_intg_chk (command integrity), prim_reg_we_check (register write protection), tlul_rsp_intg_gen (response integrity), and prim_alert_sender (security alerts). These dependencies form a chain where vulnerabilities in any component could compromise the entire GPIO module. Specifically: 1) Failure in tlul_cmd_intg_chk could allow malicious bus transactions, 2) Weaknesses in prim_reg_we_check could bypass register protection, 3) prim_alert_sender is a critical trust boundary for security notifications. The module interacts with physical pads through unfiltered IOs, making it vulnerable to voltage glitching and EM side-channel attacks.",
