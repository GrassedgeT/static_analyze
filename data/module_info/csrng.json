Applications request random numbers by issuing commands (Instantiate, Reseed, Generate, Update, Uninstantiate) to one of several dedicated instances. A central command stage (`cmd_stage`) arbitrates and dispatches these commands to a main state machine. The main FSM processes the command, requests entropy from an external source if needed, and then drives the CTR_DRBG core logic (`csrng_ctr_drbg_cmd`, `csrng_ctr_drbg_upd`, `csrng_ctr_drbg_gen`).
