    "executive_summary": "The spi_host module is an SPI host controller IP that provides hardware-level control for SPI devices. It supports standard, dual, and quad SPI modes with configurable timing parameters. The module features separate TX/RX FIFOs (288B TX, 256B RX), programmable watermark interrupts, error detection, and a pass-through mode for external SPI controller access. Its primary purpose is to communicate with SPI devices like serial NOR flash while offloading timing-critical operations from software.",
    "theory_of_operation": {
      "core_functionality": "The core functionality involves processing command segments written to the COMMAND register, which triggers the state machine to generate SPI transactions. Data flows through FIFOs before being serialized/deserialized. The module supports configurable clock polarities, phases, chip select timing, and transaction lengths. Key components include: command FIFO, data FIFOs, byte packers/unpackers, shift register, and the main FSM controller.",
