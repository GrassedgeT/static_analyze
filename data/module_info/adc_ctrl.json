### Key Findings:
1. **Complex FSM Vulnerability**: The 9-block FSM implementation is controlled through software-accessible registers without hardware interlocks, making it vulnerable to state corruption (CWE-1245).

2. **Access Control Gaps**: Critical security registers (filter configs, wakeup controls) lack documented hardware protection mechanisms, creating privilege escalation risks (CWE-1262).

3. **Runtime Configuration Risks**: Security-sensitive configurations (filter ranges, wakeup enables) can be modified at runtime without lock sequences (CWE-1233).

4. **Clock Domain Risks**: While CDC synchronizers are present, the dual-clock design (clk_i + clk_aon_i) creates potential metastability points in security-critical controls.

5. **Forensic Limitations**: The value-capture-on-interrupt mechanism provides forensic data, but samples may be overwritten before security monitors can access them.

These findings provide a comprehensive foundation for Agent2's vulnerability analysis, highlighting critical areas like FSM integrity, register access control, and runtime configuration security.
