    "executive_summary": "The alert handler is a critical security IP that aggregates and processes security alerts from various peripherals within the OpenTitan system. Its primary role is to classify these alerts, notify the processor via interrupts, and, if the processor fails to respond in a timely manner, trigger a series of escalating hardware-level responses (e.g., NMI, reset, or wiping secrets). This acts as a hardware-based fail-safe to maintain system security when software is unresponsive or compromised.",
    "theory_of_operation": {
      "core_functionality": "The module receives differential alert signals from other IPs via dedicated sender/receiver primitives (`prim_alert_sender`/`prim_alert_receiver`). Each incoming alert can be individually enabled and assigned to one of four severity classes (Class A, B, C, D) through software-programmable registers. For each class, the handler maintains an accumulation counter. If the number of alerts in a class exceeds a configured threshold, or if an interrupt for a class is not cleared by software within a timeout period, a multi-phase escalation protocol is initiated for that class.",

Once triggered (either by the accumulation counter or an IRQ timeout), this FSM sequences through up to four configurable escalation phases (Phase 0, 1, 2, 3). Each phase has a programmable duration and can be mapped to one of the physical escalation signals. This allows for a staged response, starting from a less severe action (like an NMI) and escalating to more drastic measures (like a chip reset). Incorrectly configured phase durations or mappings can either disable the escalation mechanism or cause unintended, severe system responses.",

A failure to receive a ping response generates a local alert (`loc_alert_trig[0]`), while a failure in the escalation path ping generates `loc_alert_trig[1]`. This ensures the integrity of the alert signaling infrastructure itself.",

The accumulator increments a counter; if it exceeds `CLASS*_ACCUM_THRESH_SHADOWED`, it triggers the `alert_handler_esc_timer` FSM. Separately, alerts trigger interrupts via `prim_intr_hw`. If software doesn't clear the interrupt, the `alert_handler_esc_timer` is also triggered. The escalation timer then drives the physical `esc_tx_o` signals.

This heavy use of specialized register primitives underscores the design's focus on security and resilience. The core escalation logic resides in `alert_handler_esc_timer`, which contains a complex `kAlwaysStatement` block representing its FSM.
