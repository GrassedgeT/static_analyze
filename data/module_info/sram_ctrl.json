    "executive_summary": "The SRAM controller is a peripheral on the chip interconnect bus. Its primary functions are to manage access to a dedicated SRAM, provide data and address scrambling using the PRINCE cipher, handle secure key requests from OTP, and enforce access controls, including preventing code execution from SRAM based on the system's life cycle state. It also includes a hardware-based memory initialization feature to overwrite the memory with pseudorandom data, and security hardening features like bus gating and alert generation upon detecting integrity errors.",
    "theory_of_operation": {
      "core_functionality": "The SRAM controller uses a keyed, reduced-round PRINCE cipher in Counter (CTR) mode to scramble data written to the SRAM. Addresses are also scrambled using a lightweight permutation function. The scrambling key is sideloaded from the OTP controller, making it inaccessible to software. The module also features an LFSR-based initialization mechanism to overwrite the memory with pseudorandom data, which prevents the keystream from being revealed by initializing the memory to a known value like all zeros.",

The AST shows the controlling logic with signals like `init_trig`, `init_req`, and `init_done`.",

In `sram_ctrl.sv`, the dataflow analysis shows a clear FSM-like progression for initialization (`init_d` logic) and key renewal (`key_req_pending_d`). The AST also explicitly shows the multiplexing of the SRAM write data and address signals (`sram_addr`, `sram_wdata`) between the bus interface (`tlul_*`) and the internal LFSR (`init_cnt`, `lfsr_out_integ`) during initialization, confirming the data path isolation.
