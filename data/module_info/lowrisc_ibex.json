Originally developed as 'Zero-riscy' for the PULP platform, it is now maintained by lowRISC. Within OpenTitan, the Ibex core is wrapped in the `rv_core_ibex` module, which provides TileLink Uncached Lite (TL-UL) interfaces for instruction and data buses, and integrates several security features such as a dual-core lockstep configuration, physical memory protection (PMP), and various countermeasures against physical attacks.",

The core's functionality is structured into a classic pipeline: instruction fetch (IF), instruction decode/execute (ID/EX). A dedicated Load-Store Unit (LSU) handles data memory accesses.",

The `ibex_core` depends on its pipeline stages and crucial security peripherals like `ibex_cs_registers` and `ibex_pmp`.
