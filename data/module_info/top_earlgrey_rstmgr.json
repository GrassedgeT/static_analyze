    "executive_summary": "The Reset Manager (rstmgr) is a critical IP module responsible for generating and managing all reset signals for the entire OpenTitan SoC. It handles power-on reset (POR), software-initiated resets for the full system and individual peripherals, and reset requests from the power manager. It also provides diagnostic information by capturing CPU and alert states just before a reset occurs. Its central role in system stability and recovery makes it a primary target for security analysis.",

      "core_functionality": "The rstmgr's core function is to be the central authority for all reset-related activities. It stretches the initial power-on-reset to ensure the system stabilizes. It generates a cascade of resets for different power and clock domains based on requests from the power manager (pwrmgr), software (via registers), or other hardware signals. It also includes security checks to ensure the consistency and integrity of reset signals.",

This FSM waits for the requests, coordinates with the source to acknowledge them, generates the appropriate reset cascade, and then waits for the source to de-assert the request before returning to an active state. A failure or hang in this handshake mechanism could result in a denial of service.",

Hardware signals from the power manager (pwr_i) also serve as a key input to trigger resets. The outputs are the various reset and reset-enable signals (resets_o, rst_en_o) that are distributed throughout the chip to other IP blocks. Sensitive data, such as CPU state (cpu_dump_i) and alert information (alert_dump_i), flows into crash dump registers, which are readable by software after a reset."

The `rstmgr_reg_top.sv` module handles the software interface, heavily using `prim_subreg` and `prim_subreg_ext` to implement the register file. The dataflow models in `rstmgr_reg_top` clearly show that writes to specific address offsets (`addr_hit`) are decoded into write enable signals for individual registers (e.g., `reset_req_we`, `sw_rst_ctrl_n_0_we`). The security-critical gating logic is visible in expressions like `sw_rst_ctrl_n_0_gated_we <= sw_rst_ctrl_n_0_we & sw_rst_regwen_0_qs`, directly linking the `REGWEN` registers to the control registers. The `rstmgr_ctrl` module appears to handle the logic for power manager requested resets.",

The most critical dependency is its interaction with the Power Manager (pwrmgr), from which it receives reset requests. It has no external dependencies beyond the trusted primitives and system bus. Conversely, nearly every other module in the system depends on `rstmgr` for its reset signal, making its integrity paramount.",
