    "executive_summary": "The rv_dm module is the RISC-V Debug Module for OpenTitan. It implements the RISC-V Debug Specification, providing external debugger access to the CPU and system memory. This access is primarily facilitated through a JTAG interface and a Debug Module Interface (DMI). The module's core function is to allow authorized entities to halt, resume, and inspect the state of the processor hart, as well as access system memory via a System Bus Access (SBA) port. Critically, its operation is gated by the lifecycle state of the chip, intending to prevent unauthorized debug access in deployed products.",
    "theory_of_operation": {
      "core_functionality": "The module's core functionality is to act as a bridge between an external debugger and the internal resources of the SoC. It receives commands through its JTAG/DMI interface, interprets them, and then interacts with the CPU core and the system bus. It can halt and resume the core, manage debug-related flags, and execute small programs in a dedicated program buffer. It also provides a System Bus Access (SBA) mechanism that allows the debugger to become a master on the system's TileLink bus, granting it read/write access to peripherals and memory.",

The module heavily relies on parameterized primitives like `prim_lc_sync` and `tlul_lc_gate` to enforce lifecycle-based security policies. The dataflow logic explicitly shows that debug-related outputs (`debug_req_o`, `jtag_o`) and internal enables (`dmi_en`) are gated by a combination of pinmux (`pinmux_hw_debug_en`) and lifecycle (`lc_hw_debug_en_gated`) signals.
