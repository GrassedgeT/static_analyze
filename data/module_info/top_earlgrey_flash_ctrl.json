    "executive_summary": "The top_earlgrey_flash_ctrl is a sophisticated IP module responsible for managing access to the embedded non-volatile flash memory in the Earlgrey SoC. It arbitrates between software and hardware requests, handling read, program, and erase operations. It also provides crucial security features such as memory protection through configurable regions and data scrambling to protect data at rest. The controller interfaces with the system via a TileLink Uncached Lite (TL-UL) bus and manages the physical flash macros, including their power sequencing and reset handling.",
    "theory_of_operation": {
      "core_functionality": "The flash controller's primary role is to provide a software-programmable interface for interacting with the physical flash memory. It uses a FIFO-based mechanism for read and program operations, allowing for buffered data transfers. Key operations include reading data, programming data to flash, and erasing flash pages or entire banks. Given that erase and program operations are slow, the controller manages these stateful operations, reporting status back to the software. It also handles memory protection and data scrambling.",

For programming, data is written into the `prog_fifo`. For reading, data is retrieved from the `rd_fifo`. The `flash_phy_scramble` module intercepts the data path to apply scrambling before writing to the flash and descrambling after reading. The `flash_mp` module checks memory protection rules for each access."

The `flash_phy_scramble` module, instantiating `prim_prince`, confirms the implementation of data scrambling.
