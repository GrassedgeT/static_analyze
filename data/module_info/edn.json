It translates data sizes (e.g., 128-bit CSRNG outputs to 32-bit peripheral interfaces), manages command sequences (instantiate, generate, reseed), and distributes entropy through multiple endpoints. It features two operational modes: auto-request mode for continuous hardware-controlled operations and boot-time mode for initial entropy provisioning.",
