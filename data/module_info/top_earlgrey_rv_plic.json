The AST also reveals the use of a tlul_adapter_reg, which confirms the TileLink interface. The dataflow models show that the interrupt priority registers (prio*) and interrupt enable registers (ie*) are directly controlled by the reg2hw interface, which is driven by the bus. This direct control from the bus is a potential attack surface.",
