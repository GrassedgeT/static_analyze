    "executive_summary": "The prim_generic module serves as OpenTitan's generic technology library containing pure-SystemVerilog implementations of hardware primitives. It provides technology-independent implementations that are used as functional references and for simulations. The library includes various primitive components such as flip-flops, RAMs, ROMs, clock gates, buffers, and cryptographic modules like the PRINCE scrambler. These primitives form the foundational building blocks for more complex hardware components in the SoC.",

      "core_functionality": "The prim_generic library implements abstract hardware primitives through technology-independent SystemVerilog modules. Each primitive is implemented as a wrapper that can select specific implementations based on the 'Impl' parameter. The module solves the problem of providing portable, technology-agnostic hardware primitives that can be reused across different platforms and technologies. The main workflow involves instantiating specific primitives (e.g., prim_generic_flop for flip-flops, prim_generic_ram_1p for single-port RAM) with configurable parameters that adapt them to different use cases.",
