    "executive_summary": "The aon_timer is an always-on timer module with two independent 32-bit upcounting timers: a wakeup timer and a watchdog timer. The wakeup timer features a 12-bit prescaler for extended timeout periods, while the watchdog timer has separate bark (interrupt) and bite (reset) thresholds. It operates on a low-frequency always-on clock (~200kHz) and maintains functionality during sleep/low-power states.",
    "theory_of_operation": {
      "core_functionality": "The module provides timekeeping and wakeup capabilities during low-power states. The wakeup timer counts to a programmable 64-bit threshold to trigger wakeup events, while the watchdog timer monitors system activity and triggers interrupts (bark) or system resets (bite) if not serviced. The design includes synchronization logic for cross-clock domain signals.",
