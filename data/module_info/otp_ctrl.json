It partitions the OTP memory into several logical regions with distinct access controls and security properties. Key features include hardware-managed integrity checks (digests), data scrambling for secret partitions, a key derivation interface for other IPs, and a dedicated interface for the life cycle controller. Access is primarily controlled via a TL-UL register interface, which allows software to initiate read, write, and digest operations in the OTP memory.",

It implements security-by-design features such as calculating and storing integrity digests for partitions, performing periodic checks of data against these digests, scrambling the content of secret partitions, and providing derived keys to other peripherals like flash and SRAM controllers.",

The register file logic in `otp_ctrl_core_reg_top.sv` shows that write access to critical commands like `direct_access_cmd` is gated by the `direct_access_regwen_qs` signal, which is a positive security practice.

The `otp_ctrl_scrmbl.sv` module instantiates `prim_present`, confirming the use of the PRESENT cipher.
