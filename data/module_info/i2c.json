    "executive_summary": "The I2C module implements a controller-target combo supporting both I2C host and device modes with speeds up to 1 Mbaud. It handles serial communication through SCL (clock) and SDA (data) lines, featuring FIFO buffers for data transfer, programmable timing parameters, and support for multi-controller environments. Security features include TL-UL bus integrity protection and configurable target address filtering.",

      "core_functionality": "The IP core implements I2C protocol operations including start/stop conditions, 7-bit addressing, and ACK/NACK handling. In controller mode, it initiates transactions through the FMT FIFO; in target mode, it responds to address matches using the TX FIFO. Data flows through four FIFOs: FMT (controller commands), RX (received data), TX (transmit data), and ACQ (target acquisition data).",
