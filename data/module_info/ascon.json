    "executive_summary": "The Ascon module is a cryptographic accelerator implementing the NIST-standardized Ascon authenticated encryption algorithm. It provides hardware acceleration for authenticated encryption/decryption operations using 128-bit keys and tags. The module supports both Ascon-128 (64-bit blocks) and Ascon-128a (128-bit blocks) variants. Key features include shadow registers for critical controls, side-channel countermeasures (planned DOM masking), and secure wipe functionality.",

It initializes a 320-bit sponge state with key and nonce, processes data through permutation rounds (P12 for initialization, Pr per block), and extracts ciphertext/tag. For decryption, it outputs plaintext before verification, requiring software to validate the tag before use.",
