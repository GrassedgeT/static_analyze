    "executive_summary": "The rv_timer is a configurable RISC-V timer IP module that provides 64-bit counters with programmable prescalers and step values. It generates interrupts when timer values reach programmed compare thresholds, conforming to the RISC-V privileged specification. The module supports multiple timers per hart and multiple harts, with security features including TL-UL bus integrity protection.",
    "theory_of_operation": {
      "core_functionality": "The timer module implements 64-bit counters that increment by a configured step value each time a prescaler times out. When a timer's value (mtime) reaches or exceeds a programmed compare value (mtimecmp), it generates an interrupt. The module assumes stable clock operation and does not support low-power modes.",
