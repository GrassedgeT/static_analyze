    "executive_summary": "The AES unit is a cryptographic accelerator peripheral that supports AES-128, AES-192, and AES-256 encryption and decryption. It implements several standard block cipher modes including ECB, CBC, CFB, OFB, and CTR. The module is designed with security as a primary consideration, incorporating countermeasures against side-channel analysis (SCA) and fault injection (FI) attacks, such as 1st-order masking, multi-rail FSMs, and sparse state encodings. It communicates with the system via a TL-UL bus interface for register-based configuration and data transfer, and includes an optional interface for sideloading keys directly from a key manager.",
    "theory_of_operation": {
      "core_functionality": "The AES unit uses a single, shared datapath for both encryption and decryption, meaning it can only perform one operation at a time. A key feature is the on-the-fly generation of round keys from a single initial key provided by the processor. This reduces storage requirements and the attack surface, as intermediate round keys are not stored in accessible registers. The datapath's core submodules are combinational, with sequential logic limited to the State, Full Key, and Decryption Key registers, which are not exposed on the bus interface. This architecture allows for overlapping operations; the processor can write the next data block or read the previous output block while the current block is being processed. The unit will stall if software does not read the output data before the next block is ready, preventing data loss.",

The cryptographic operations themselves are broken down into `aes_sub_bytes.sv`, `aes_shift_rows.sv`, `aes_mix_columns.sv`, and `aes_key_expand.sv`. A key observation is the parameterization of the S-Box implementation (`SecSBoxImpl`), allowing for different versions such as LUT-based, or masked variants (`aes_sbox_dom.sv`, `aes_sbox_canright_masked.sv`). This parameterization is a critical configuration point for security.

The `keymgr`, `edn`, and `lc_ctrl` are considered trusted hardware components, but their interfaces are attack vectors if not properly secured. Internally, the design is highly modular. `aes_core` depends on numerous sub-modules for each step of the AES algorithm. A notable dependency is `aes_sbox` and its various implementations, indicating that the core substitution operation, a cornerstone of AES security, is a pluggable component.
