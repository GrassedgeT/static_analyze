    "executive_summary": "The Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM) module is a general-purpose IP designed to generate PWM signals with adjustable duty cycles, primarily for controlling tri-color LEDs. It features a parameterizable number of output channels (up to 6), with independent control over duty cycle, phase, and polarity for each. The IP operates with separate clock domains for the TL-UL bus interface and the core logic, allowing it to continue functioning in low-power states. Key features include a hardware-controlled blink mode that toggles between two duty cycles and a heartbeat mode for linear sweeps, a programmable pulse frequency via a 27-bit clock divider, and adjustable resolution for fine-grained control.",
    "theory_of_operation": {
      "core_functionality": "The PWM module generates pulse trains for multiple output channels. All channels share a common pulse frequency determined by a global clock divider (CFG.CLK_DIV) and a resolution setting (CFG.DC_RESN). The core of the IP is a central phase counter that increments based on the divided core clock. For each channel, a comparator uses the phase counter's value along with channel-specific parameters (phase delay, duty cycle) to generate the final PWM output. The module supports three main modes per channel: standard (fixed duty cycle), blinking (toggling between two duty cycles), and heartbeat (linearly sweeping the duty cycle).",

Its increment value and overflow point are determined by the `CFG.CLK_DIV` and `CFG.DC_RESN` registers. The counter is enabled by `CFG.CNTR_EN`; disabling this bit resets the counter to zero. This FSM's state (the counter value) is fundamental to the timing of all PWM outputs.",

When `blink_en` is active for a channel, this counter determines when to switch between the two programmed duty cycles (A and B) or when to increment/decrement the duty cycle for the heartbeat effect. Its behavior is governed by the `BLINK_PARAM` registers (x and y fields). It is reset when the blink/heartbeat feature is disabled.",

These register writes (e.g., to `CFG`, `PWM_EN`, `DUTY_CYCLE_n`, `PWM_PARAM_n`) are synchronized to the `clk_core_i` domain via dedicated Clock Domain Crossing (CDC) modules (`prim_reg_cdc`). The synchronized configuration values are then fed from the `pwm_reg_top` module to the `pwm_core` and `pwm_chan` modules. The `pwm_core` uses `CFG` values to drive the main phase counter. Each `pwm_chan` instance uses its specific parameters (duty cycle, blink settings, etc.) along with the global phase counter value to compute its final PWM output signal, which is then driven to the physical `pwm_o` pins."

The design relies heavily on `prim_reg_cdc` instances for safe synchronization of configuration data from the bus clock domain to the core clock domain. An issue in the CDC logic could lead to metastability and unpredictable behavior. The module is reset by `rst_ni` and `rst_core_ni` for their respective domains."

The logic in `pwm_core.sv` centers on the `phase_ctr_q`, which acts as the base timekeeper. The most complex logic resides in `pwm_chan.sv`, which implements the per-channel duty cycle and blink/heartbeat calculations.

This indicates that the primary external interaction boundary is the TL-UL bus interface in `pwm_reg_top`.

There appears to be no internal hardware validation to prevent software from writing dangerous combinations of parameters, such as a very small `CLK_DIV` value which could dramatically increase the PWM frequency and power consumption, or setting phase delays for all channels to zero, maximizing current spikes. The hardware trusts the input from software completely."
