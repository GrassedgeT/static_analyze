It provides TileLink Uncached Light (TL-UL) host interfaces for instruction and data ports, implements address translation, supports NMI for security alerts, handles error status collection and alert generation, and includes crash dump collection capabilities. Its primary security features include lockstep core execution, bus integrity protection, and ICache scrambling with OTP-sideloaded keys.",
