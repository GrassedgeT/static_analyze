Based on the comprehensive analysis of the pattgen module documentation, AST, and dependencies, here is the structured vulnerability analysis report:

    "executive_summary": "PATTGEN is a pattern generator IP with two independent channels that produce serial data patterns synchronized to programmable clocks. Each channel has configurable data patterns, timing parameters, polarity settings, and inactive output levels. The module generates interrupts upon pattern completion and includes security alert mechanisms.",
    "theory_of_operation": {
      "core_functionality": "Generates serial data patterns using a three-counter state machine (clock, bit, and repetition counters). Patterns are defined through data registers and output via PDA (data) and PCL (clock) pins. The predivider register scales the system clock for PCL generation.",

State transitions occur when counters reach configured limits (prediv, len, reps).",

      ],
      "data_flow": "Software configures data patterns via DATA_CHx registers. During operation, the module shifts out pattern bits serially: 1) Data is loaded from registers, 2) Bits are output on PDA synchronized to PCL, 3) Inactive levels are applied when disabled or completed. Data paths lack integrity protection."
