After passing these tests, the data is passed through a SHA-3 conditioner to improve its statistical properties.

The dataflow models show that control signals derived from registers like `reg2hw.conf` and `reg2hw.entropy_control` have a significant impact on the data path, for instance determining `es_bypass_mode`. The presence of numerous `entropy_src_watermark_reg` and `entropy_src_cntr_reg` instances confirms the hardware support for tracking health test statistics and failures. The firmware override path is also clearly visible, with `fw_ov_control` registers directly influencing data multiplexers and FIFO controls.

The most security-critical dependency is the `sha3` module, which acts as the entropy conditioner. Any flaw in the `sha3` implementation would compromise the core security guarantee of the conditioned entropy. Externally, the module trusts the quality of the input from the PTRNG and trusts that the consumer (e.g., CSRNG) will handle the provided entropy securely.
